Bugs Reported (nor reproduced):
  *. At 38400, upload with linux rz -e is very slow, but download with linux sz -e is plenty fast.

New Features:
  *. if prog button held for 4 seconds, do a factory reset.
  *. make a persistent-ish ftp shell
  *. Support ring signal, Server Conns on Hold, and true RING msgs.
  *. Ability to use protocols for at&g, and maybe have alternative at+web
  *. Ability to ftp file streamdown, like at&g.. maybe at+ftp
  *. Support switching between CONNECT 1 and CONNECT 1200 messages

  --- C= Modem tech details:
  1650 Automodem
VIC-20: B1=37136, B2=37138
C64: B1=56577, B2=56579

To receive a connection/call:
Poke B2,32.  Poke B1,0
if peek(b1)and8 = 0then "RING!"

To dial out:
Poke B2,32.  Poke B1,0

poke b1,32 (pick up the phone)
poke b1,0 - pause - poke b1,32 - pause pulse the line once per digit


1660 Modem:
Pin J: /On Hook - output from computer
Pin F: /Ring Indicator - signal from modem
Pin H,K: DCD, CTS - inputs from modem, tied together?
Pin L: DSR grounded
Pin E: DTR NC

if(peek(56577) and 8) then print "c64 ringing"
if(peek(37136)and8) then print "vic-20 ringing"

To initiate a dialtone C64:
oh 56577:hi 32:lo 255-32
poke(oh 2),(peek(oh 2)or hi)
poke oh,(peek(oh) and lo)

To initiate a dialtone VIC:
oh 37136:hi 32:lo 255-32
poke (oh 2),(peek(oh 2)or hi)
poke oh,(peek(oh)and lo)

To hang up the phone C64:
oh 56577:hi 32:lo 255-32
poke oh,(peek(oh) or hi)

To hang up the phone VIC-20:
oh 37136:hi 32:lo 255-32
poke oh,(peek(oh) and hi)

Carrier Detect 64:
OH 56577:
IF((PEEK(OH)AND16) 16) THEN PRINT "NO CARRIER":
IF((PEEK(OH)AND16) =0)THEN PRINT "CARRIER DETECTED"

Carrier Detect VIC-20:
OH 37136:
IF((PEEK(OH) AND 16) 16)THEN PRINT'NO CARRIER":
IF((PEEK(OH) AND 16) 0) THEN PRINT'CARRIER DETECTED"

To make a call: initiate a dialtone, then hang up for 60 milliseconds, and then pick up for 40 milliseconds per pulse


1670 Modem:
Pin J: Speed Indicate - output from modem -- high=300,low=1200
Pin F: /Rl from modem
Pins H,K: DCD,CTS from modem - DCD is low on carrier detect
Pin L: DSR grounded
Pin E: DTR from the computer - to force a hang-up

1670 allows the DCD line to float via a dip-switch, FOR PLUS/4 COMPATIBILITY!!!!!

m0=0=1670
m0=1=1650
m0=2=1660

Zelch Hang Up:
1670 - Pin H high == already hung up, otherwise +++
1650 - poke56579,32:poke56577,0 == set bit 5 for output, all others input, then pull pin J (the pin you just made output) low.
1660 - poke56577,32:poke56579,0 == pull pin J high, but then make it an input?! makes no sense.

Zelch Pick Up I assume
1670 - Do Nothing
1650 - poke 56579,38:poke56577,2 == set pin J,D,E (?,DTS,RTS) to outputs, then pull RTS high and set the others low. Really just pulling pin J low.
1660 - poke 56579,32:poke56577,255-32 == set pin J to output, then pull pin J low.

Zelch detect incoming:
1670 - get#5,a$;ifa$="1" then 300, if "5" then 1200. Simple!
1650 - if(peek(56577)and8)=0then wait until if(peek(56577)and16)=0 to pick up the phone!
1660 - if(peek(56577)and8)=0then wait until if(peek(56577)and16)=0 to pick up the phone!

Carrier Detect
if(peek(56577)and16)=0 the online
if(peek(56577)and16)=16 the offline
That means pin H is reversed?!
